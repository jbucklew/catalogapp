# Catalog App

## Description
This is a Flask application using SQLAlchemy to manipulate a sqlite database. Users can create new categories and add items to those categories.  Items can also be edited and deleted by the user that created the item.

There are 2 json api endpoints, one to return a list of categories and the other will return the item table data for a selected item.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Flask 0.10.1 (http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* SQLAlchemy 1.0.11 (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
* Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta (https://getbootstrap.com)

## To Run Application:
* Download the application and save to any directory
* Run the applicaton from the command prompt using: python application.py
* Open your web browser and connect to http://localhost:8000 to use the application

## Research
I was able to use the classes to assist with most of the application.  I also used the Flask, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap documentation. Item descriptions are from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org).
